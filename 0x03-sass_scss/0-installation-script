# SASS/SCSS Installation Steps
# This script outlines the process to install SASS using npm

# Prerequisites:
# 1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 16 or higher recommended)
#    Check your Node.js version with: node --version

# Installation Steps:

# 1. Initialize a new npm project (if you haven't already)
#    This creates a package.json file to manage dependencies
npm init -y

# 2. Install SASS locally as a development dependency
#    Using version 3.7.4 as specified in the requirements
npm install sass@3.7.4 --save-dev

# 3. Verify the installation
#    Check that SASS was installed correctly
npx sass --version

# 4. (Optional) Add a script to your package.json for easy compilation
#    Edit your package.json and add under the "scripts" section:
#    "compile:sass": "sass scss:css --watch"
#
#    This would watch for changes in scss/ directory and compile to css/

# Usage:
# To compile SCSS files to CSS, you can use:
# npx sass input.scss output.css

# Or use the watch mode to automatically compile on changes:
# npx sass --watch scss:css

# Note: The above commands assume you have:
# - SCSS files in a 'scss' directory
# - Want to output CSS to a 'css' directory

# For more information, refer to the SASS documentation:
